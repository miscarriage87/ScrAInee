# Ralph Fix Plan

## 🔴 High Priority (MANDATORY - Phase 1)
- [ ] Set up basic project structure and build system
- [ ] Define core data structures and types
- [ ] Implement basic input/output handling
- [ ] Create test framework and initial tests

## 🟡 Medium Priority (MANDATORY - Phase 1)
- [ ] Add error handling and validation
- [ ] Implement core business logic
- [ ] Add configuration management
- [ ] Create user documentation

## 🟢 Low Priority / Optional (Phase 2)
- [ ] Performance optimization (Optional)
- [ ] Extended feature set (Nice-to-have)
- [ ] Integration with external services (Optional)
- [ ] Advanced error recovery (Enhancement)

## 🚀 Autonomous Features (Phase 3 - Ralph proposes these!)
<!-- Ralph will add autonomous feature proposals here when Phase 1+2 are complete -->
<!-- Format: - [ ] [AUTONOMOUS] Feature description - added by Ralph -->

## ✅ Completed
- [x] Project initialization

## Notes
- **Phase 1**: Complete all High and Medium Priority items first
- **Phase 2**: Then complete all Low Priority / Optional items
- **Phase 3**: When all above are done, Ralph enters AUTONOMOUS MODE
  - Ralph analyzes the codebase and proposes new features
  - Each feature is documented here before implementation
  - Continue until max API calls reached
- Ensure each feature is properly tested
- Update this file after each milestone
